<p>Calling all HW entrepreneurs! HW Inc is a five-day summer program for motivated students to explore business and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Formerly known as the HW StartUp Scramble, HW Inc will allow students to learn about the fundamentals of venture creation while networking with esteemed HW alumni in the business community. Following an initial pitch session on Tuesday, students will form teams around specific ventures. Students will spend each morning with teachers who will cover the basics of marketing, profit determination, and pitch presentation formats. Afternoons are reserved for group work where teams will complete assignments related to the morning's lecture. On Saturday night, each team will present its venture to a panel, basing its pitch on the assignments they completed over the course of the week. </p>
<p>This program is open to all HW students, regardless of any prior entrepreneurial experience. By Saturday night, every student will have experienced the thrill of venture creation and have a fundamental knowledge of what business is, how it works, and how it can be successful. By combining expert mentorship and hands-on work, HW Inc is a unique and challenging way to explore the world of entrepreneurship.
